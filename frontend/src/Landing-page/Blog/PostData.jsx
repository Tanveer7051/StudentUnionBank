        <p><strong>Investing early</strong> is one of the smartest financial decisions you can make. It takes advantage of <strong>compound interest</strong> and gives your money time to grow.</p>

        <h3>Why It Matters:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Compound Interest:</strong> Interest on interest can turn small investments into large sums over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Time Advantage:</strong> Starting in your 20s gives you decades for growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong> Younger investors can afford to take more risk, which often brings higher returns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Real-Life Example:</h3>
        <p>Investing <strong>$200/month</strong> from age 22 to 60 at an 8% return yields nearly <strong>$550,000</strong>. Waiting until age 32 yields only <strong>$240,000</strong>. That’s the cost of waiting.</p>

        <h3>Where to Start:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Employer 401(k):</strong> Especially if there’s a company match — it’s free money!</li>
          <li><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> Grow your money tax-free and withdraw it tax-free in retirement.</li>
          <li><strong>Index Funds & ETFs:</strong> Low-risk, diversified investment options for beginners.</li>
          <li><strong>Robo-Advisors:</strong> Automated investing based on your risk profile.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tips for Long-Term Success:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automate</strong> your investments monthly</li>
          <li><strong>Stay invested</strong> even when the market dips</li>
          <li><strong>Diversify</strong> to reduce risk</li>
          <li><strong>Review</strong> your strategy annually</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Misconceptions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>"I need a lot of money to start."</em> — False. You can start with as little as $10.</li>
          <li><em>"Investing is too risky."</em> — Not investing at all is riskier over time due to inflation.</li>
          <li><em>"I’ll wait until I earn more."</em> — The earlier you start, the better.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>Time is your greatest ally. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your wealth grow. The best time to invest was yesterday — the second-best time is <strong>today</strong>.</p>
