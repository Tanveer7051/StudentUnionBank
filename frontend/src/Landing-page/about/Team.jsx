        Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Tanveer Ahmed</strong>, the founder and CEO of Student Union Bank. 
        As a student myself, I understood the struggles of managing money, savings, 
        and transactions with limited resources. Thatâ€™s why I decided to build a 
        platform that puts <em>students and young professionals first</em>.
      </p>
      <p className="p-3">
        My mission is to ensure that banking feels easy, transparent, and 
        future-ready for the next generation. ðŸš€
